This folder contains code used to convert models from Abaqus proprietary results format to open source formats such as VTK.

It also includes other snippets of in-development code for a study that involves registering PET-CT data with finite element predicted wall stresses. This code allows imaging data such as inflammation (using a PET tracer) to be mapped directly to the nodes of the FE mesh geometry.
